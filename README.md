# Big_Street_Lettings

The project is entitled as “Big Street Lettings” and is a Real Estate Web Portal. The
main aim of the project is to set up the platform for easy dealing of property in
which seller, customer and broker are in firm interaction with each other on a single
platform. The proposed project is Business-to-Business (B2B), Business-to-
Customer (B2C) and Customer-to-Customer(C2C) model. All the three models are
synchronized by an admin profile. The project provides platform to the customers
to find out property description and property rates they are interested for and
could also interact directly with the broker and other customers too. This would
help customers to deal easily for their required property and also helpful for the
brokers to directly come in contact with the interested customers. The Real Estate
Portal would give proper description related to the property and also the estimate
property rates so the customers could find easy way for proper dealing.
